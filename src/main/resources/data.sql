VALUES ('Daniel Farke sacked by Norwich City despite first league win of season',
    'Norwich City head coach Daniel Farke has been sacked hours after their first win of the Premier League season.<br/>The Canaries won 2-1 at Brentford, but remain bottom of the Premier League with five points from 11 games.<br/>Farke had led Norwich to promotion from the Championship twice since 2017.<br/>"We feel now is the right time for a change to give ourselves the best opportunity of retaining our Premier League status," said sporting director Stuart Webber.<br/>In Farke`s post-match interview with BBC Sport, he gave no indication he knew he was about to lose his job.<br/>"We definitely have a chance [of survival]," he said. "It`s a long marathon. The longer we work together, the better we will be as a team. I can`t guarantee we`ll stay in the league but don`t write us off." The German was Norwich manager for 208 games in total, winning 87 of them.<br/>He took over in 2017, leading the Canaries to the Championship title in his second season.',

    ('The 100 greatest TV series of the 21st Century',
    'In recent years, BBC Culture has conducted an annual poll of film critics, experts and industry figures from around the world to decide on the greatest films in a particular category: you may have come across our 100 greatest films directed by women list in 2019 and our 100 greatest non-English language films in 2018, among others. However, this year, it felt about time that we turned our attention to another art form: television. That`s in part because TV has played such a crucial role in many of our lives over the past 18 months, when we have relied on it for information, entertainment, solace and inspiration in equal measure.<br/>But also it felt like the right time to survey the television landscape because arguably it has been the defining art form of the past 21 years: where once, rightly or wrongly, it was largely patronised as cinema`s younger, more rough-and-ready sibling, today its artistic credibility is unassailable, while the advent of streaming platforms has also given shows the ability to reach unprecedented global audiences all at once. And so, in order to mark TV`s ascendancy, we have decided to ask the question: what are the greatest TV series of the 21st Century?<br/>While in no way definitive, the answers we have collated are fascinating – and, we hope, will inspire TV lovers everywhere to both seek out titles they haven`t seen before, and further reflect on and discuss ones they have. In total, 460 different series were voted for by 206 TV experts – critics, journalists, academics and industry figures – who came from 43 countries, from Albania to Uruguay. Of these voters, 100 were women, 104 were men, and two were non-binary. Each voter listed their 10 favourite TV series of the 21st Century, which we scored and ranked to produce the top 100 listed below.',

    ('How a Portuguese fishing village tamed a 100ft wave',
    'It was a clear day in September in the Portuguese beach resort of Nazaré. The sun sparkled off the cornflower-blue ocean, which broke gently against the foot of the rugged cliffs of its North Beach. The 16th-Century fort that sits atop the cliffs was dotted with a handful of tourists posing for pictures in front of its bright-red lighthouse. It couldn`t have been a greater contrast to the scene that would unfold in just a month`s time.<br/>When the first swell of the big wave surfing season, which generally runs from October to March, rolls in, the road to the fort and the cliffs surrounding it fill with thousands of people. All of them are hoping to catch a glimpse of the world`s best big wave surfers attempting their profession`s ultimate feat: risking everything to ride the monstrous, skyscraper-sized waves generated by Europe`s largest underwater canyon.<br/>Nazaré locals always knew their waves were big, although for generations they had no idea of their dimensions. On stormy winter days, they`d drive to the lighthouse to soak up their power. The whole area would feel like it was shaking, the thunderous sound reaching the mountains. While local surfers would surf at Nazaré up to a point, they knew when it was time to get out. They certainly wouldn`t dream of tackling the monsters that came in with the big swells.',
